		<h1>Welcome to PartyPeople!</h1>
		<p>Though we might have a silly name, we have a mighty goal. There are enough barriers to voting as it is, so to make the process a little bit easier, PartyPeople provides information about current elections and candidates, as well as information about the political parties and political information about the states in the US.</p>
		<p>While this site is intended for eligible voters to increase their knowledge about current elections in their area, at both a local, state, and federal level, anyone is welcome to browse for political information. You can go from one page to another, seeing how elections, candidates, parties, and states relate, and increasing your knowledge about the current political arena.</p>

		<h1>Data</h1>

		<h3>Data Collection</h3>
		<p>For the first phase of the project, since only a few instances of each model were needed, team members manually collected data, either by using the API's listed below, or going to reputable sites like a candidate's personal website or a state's government website. </p><p> The second phase composed of a much greater momentum of data collection. The goal of the second phase was not only to make the pages dynamic, but to make the website insightful in some manner (more or less assembling lots of relevant information). In order to accomplish this task, a variety of steps needed to take place.</p>

		<h3>Locating Resourceful APIs</h3>
		<p>Of course, we can't just make up the data ourselves, so we have to look towards other publicly disclosed APIs that provide the data we need. While there are thousands of APIs out there, the APIs that really stick out are Google Civic API, GovTrackUs API, OpenFEC API, Huffington Post API, Mediawiki API, and Open States. Normally, it wouldn't be ideal to use so many APIs, but the fact of the matter is that the data we're looking for isn't condensed in a select few APIs.</p>

		<h3>Send RESTful Requests to APIs</h3>
		<p> You would think that the best part of data collection is finding the data sources, but assembling and interpreting the received data brings out your true inner excitement (but not the giggling kind of excitement, this is serious work). Much like using power tools in construction, we often use "tools" in programming, in this case, Python libraries/modules. </p><p> BeautifulSoup is perhaps one of our most widely used Python module in our scraping programs. It has a profound nature of translating a URL request into a multi-depth, dictionary based Python object. This module equips the programmer to easily map objects from the response to manipulate. The issue with using BeautifulSoup, however, is that BeautifulSoup is primarily for converting HTML into Python based objects (scraping website UIs). </p><p> Which brings me to the more important libraries/modules... </p><p> For generating and sending a request, urlopen is the recommended Python module to use for RESTful requests. Because urlopen is primarily based on the REST, a core feature that urlopen provides is the manner in which it manages responses. We use urlopen to send requests to the API endpoints, and to receiving the response from the API endpoints. Most of our scraping programs are written to feed urlopen as an argument into a BeautifulSoup object so we can continue to manipulate the data in the response. Now the question is, does Python provide a module for manipulating JSON specific responses? </p><p> Yes, they do indeed. Well it turns out the json, the Python module, translates the JSON response into a multi-depth dictionary based Python object, much like BeautifulSoup (is that a coincidence?). We use json to read the data in the json object in order to filter, massage, and interpret the received data. </p><p> When there are thousands (tens of thousands for us) of generated requests, the program starts to run slow. This is when the threading Python module comes in handy. Threading is a powerful computer science paradigm thats been around for decades, but threading can have grave consequences. You have to be careful about when you read or write to files that multiple threads may have access to. If you can manage these accesses in sync, then the beauties of multithreading will show in your program's performance.

		<h3>Filter Data in Response</h3>
		<p>Its really simple to filter the data if you have the right tools. In our case, Python and its modules are very handy tools in making our task easier. In this stage, we stored the relevant data that we wanted to keep, and threw away any other data. Essentially, any data that pertained to political candidates, states, state elections, and political parties (especially any metadata that linked each of these) we tried to save locally. </p><p> Several general attributes of interest: foreign key ids, names, and critical meta data (such as location, etc.) </p>

		<h3>Massage Data</h3>
		<p> Finally, we have to "massage" (means to alter the data to your needs) the data to match the needs of the backend and frontend teams. This stage is important in ensuring that the data can be and is useful to these teams, else it is just a bunch of raw, senseless data. Also, this stage doesn't take place until we've collected and saved all the data from the listed data sources. </p><p> The steps we took in this stage:

		Update the files to ensure everything is in JSON format
		Map the saved data responses to each other
		Join the saved data responses
		Reorganize and massage the result of the join
		Forward final result to Backend (for database storage) and Frontend (for a json schema/example) teams. </p>
		
		<p>For the second phase of the project, the following APIs were used to collect data to obtain many instances of each model: </p>
		<b><a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/v2/">Google Civic API</a>:</b> Candidates (names, party affiliation, elections they're in), Elections (basic information)
		<br>
		<b><a href="https://sunlightlabs.github.io/openstates-api/">Open States API</a>:</b> all candidates in a State
		<br>
		<b><a href="https://api.ballotpedia.org/v1/documentation">BallotPedia</a>:</b> Elections(type, state it's in, description, election date), Candidates (names, summary, date of birth, party affiliation, previous offices held)
		<br>
		<b><a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Tutorial">MediaWiki API</a>:</b> States (governors, basic State information), Parties (basic party information)
		<br>
		<b><a href="https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/">OpenFEC API</a>:</b> Federal Elections information and date, Candidate information
		<br>
		<b><a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api">Huffington Post API</a>:</b> Polling information
		<br>

		<h1>Tools</h1>
		<h3>Front End</h3>
		<b><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/components.html">Twitter Bootstrap</a></b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Carousel</b> - used to create the home page with sliding images.</li>
			<li><b>Grid System</b> - used to make the website responsive and more organized.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b><a href="http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable">Primeng DataTables</a></b></p>
		<p><b><a href="https://angular.io/features.html">Angular2</a></b> was added as the Front End framework for Phase 2. The benefits to using Angular is that the team could create dynamic web pages instead of hard coding a bunch of static pages. Angular has this concept of components, where you can tie HTML, CSS, and some TypeScript business logic all together into one directive. Two components were created for each model, one to display the models page of that model (a table with all the instances), and one component to display the details of an instance of that model. Components were also created for the header, the about page, and the home page.</p><p> Since Angular is dynamic one-page website, the team created a page with the header, and then inserted what's called a tag. Whenever the user goes to a URL, Angular will parse the route and insert the appropriate component into the tag, based on the routes the team previously defined.</p>
		<h3>Back End</h3>
		<b>AWS Hosting</b>
		<br>
		<b>Flask</b>
		<br>
		<b>SQLAlchemy</b>
		<h3>Others</h3>
		<b>Apiary API Design</b> - used to design an API so other developers can get our data. Apiary has a pretty simple UI and an in-site editor that makes creating the documentation easier.
		<br>
		<b>Slack</b> - used for communication. Our team created a GitHub channel, where all GitHub updates were posted. We also had a Scheduling channel, where we posted when we were planning on working and which other team members could join. 
		<br>
		<b>yUML</b> - lets the user draw simple UML diagrams online. UML diagrams help visualize the interactions between classes or objects. In our case, we were able to map the interactions between each of our pillars, and list out the attributes in each pillar.
		<br>
		<b>ZenHub GitHub Extension</b> - changes the UI in GitHub so it is easier to visualize tasks and their current state. ZenHub creates boards in GitHub, so you can click and drag tasks across boards. Our team mainly used the boards to categorize the tasks as To-Do, In Progress, In-Review, and Closed. There are more advanced features that our team has not yet explored, but may get to as the project progresses.
