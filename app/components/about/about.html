		<h1>Welcome to PartyPeople!</h1>
		<p>Though we might have a silly name, we have a mighty goal. There are enough barriers to voting as it is, so to make the process a little bit easier, PartyPeople provides information about current elections and candidates, as well as information about the political parties and political information about the states in the US.</p>
		<p>While this site is intended for eligible voters to increase their knowledge about current elections in their area, at both a local, state, and federal level, anyone is welcome to browse for political information. You can go from one page to another, seeing how elections, candidates, parties, and states relate, and increasing your knowledge about the current political arena.</p>

		<h1>Tools</h1>
		<h3>Front End</h3>
		<b>Twitter Bootstrap</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Carousel</b> - used to create the home page with sliding images.</li>
			<li><b>Data Tables</b> - used to create a table that is sortable by any column, and includes a search bar to filter the table rows based on key words.</li>
			<li><b>Grid System</b> - used to make the website responsive and more organized.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Back End</h3>
		<b>AWS Hosting</b>
		<br>
		<b>Flask</b>
		<br>
		<b>SQLAlchemy</b>
		<h3>Others</h3>
		<b>Apiary API Design</b> - used to design an API so other developers can get our data. Apiary has a pretty simple UI and an in-site editor that makes creating the documentation easier.
		<br>
		<b>Slack</b> - used for communication. Our team created a GitHub channel, where all GitHub updates were posted. We also had a Scheduling channel, where we posted when we were planning on working and which other team members could join. 
		<br>
		<b>yUML</b> - lets the user draw simple UML diagrams online. UML diagrams help visualize the interactions between classes or objects. In our case, we were able to map the interactions between each of our pillars, and list out the attributes in each pillar.
		<br>
		<b>ZenHub GitHub Extension</b> - changes the UI in GitHub so it is easier to visualize tasks and their current state. ZenHub creates boards in GitHub, so you can click and drag tasks across boards. Our team mainly used the boards to categorize the tasks as To-Do, In Progress, In-Review, and Closed. There are more advanced features that our team has not yet explored, but may get to as the project progresses.
